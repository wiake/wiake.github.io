              Puppy Linux Forum has expanded over the years. It now provides
              support for not only Puppy distributions, but also a number of
              similarly small and flexible distributions, which were inspired by
              Puppy and generally provide some of the look-and-feel and
              functionality of Puppy itself but using other distribution
              methodologies, such as for example being based on unique container
              system, Debian Live, Linux From Scratch, Tiny Core Linux, or
              Slitaz etc. Furthermore, everyone has the right to create or
              remaster (make a 'spin' or fork) her or his own distribution and
              bring it to the attention of the Forum. <br>
              <br>
              One result of that increased diversity is that not every
              application created for one distribution, nor technique for
              accomplishing some task in one distribution, may work in another
              distribution. Forum users should be particularly careful to post
              any comments, questions, bug reports etc.. about any particular
              distribution in the specific sections/threads assigned for that
              distribution. Carefully posting in appropriate threads helps avoid
              confusion and avoids thread moderators having to waste time
              answering or re-directing inappropriate questions or comments.
              Each distribution has its own thread in either the Derivative
              Section, the Projects Section or the Cutting Edge Section. The
              following is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to provide
              an overview of that diversity. <br>
              <br>
              Amongst the downloadable distributions you can find in various
              sections of the forum are: <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">1. Puppy Linux itself. <br>
                <br>
                Please refer to <a href="http://puppylinux.com/download.html" target="_blank"
                  class="postlink">http://puppylinux.com/download.html</a> for a
                list of the latest woof-CE built puppies.</span> <br>
              <br>
              Puppy Linux has been developed following on from the design of its
              originator, BarryK. <br>
              <br>
              Though the underlying operation, boot mechanisms, major control
              scripts etc, of Puppy Linux are unique, it nowadays comes in
              multiple flavours such as individual versions that use Debian,
              Ubuntu, or Slackware libraries and application repositories as
              part of their operating design. Nowadays, official Puppy Linux
              distributions are assembled via a build system called woof-CE. In
              addition, various individuals create their own specialised
              versions of Puppy Linux by remastering woof-CE built Pups. <br>
              <br>
              As with most of the distributions described in this post, "if you
              are a member of the Puppy Linux community, then you are a member
              of the Puppy Linux Team". However, Puppy does have some officially
              appointed stewards, who are listed here: <br>

              Some information about Puppy remasters, and about Puppy stewards'
              view on the relationship between Puppy itself and the other
              distributions mentioned in this post can be found in Puppy

              <span style="font-weight: bold">2. EasyOS.</span> <br>
              <br>
              "EasyOS is designed from scratch to support containers. Any app
              can run in a container, in fact an entire desktop can run in a
              container. Container management is by a simple GUI, no messing
              around on the commandline. The container mechanism is named Easy
              Containers, and is designed from scratch (Docker, LXC, etc are not
              used). Easy Containers are extremely efficient, with almost no
              overhead -- the base size of each container is only several KB". <br>
              <br>
              EasyOS is created and maintained by BarryK, the originator of
              Puppy Linux. <br>

              <span style="font-weight: bold">3. Quirky.</span> <br>
              <br>
              "Quirky is similar to Puppy from the User Interface and
              applications point of view, but underneath has significant
              differences. Originally, Quirky was a "full installation" only,
              with special snapshot and recovery features. Later, live-CD
              running-in-RAM with session-saving was added, and a "frugal
              installation" mode, however all of this is different from Puppy".
              <br>
              <br>
              "Quirky Linux is an experimental distribution, created by Barry
              Kauler in 2013, after he retired from leading the Puppy Linux
              project". <br>
              <br>
              "As from December 16, 2018, Quirky Linux is a discontinued
              project." <br>

              <br>
              "Fatdog64 Linux is a small yet versatile 64-bit multi-user Linux
              distribution. Originally created as a "fatter" (=more built-in
              applications) derivative of Puppy Linux, Fatdog has grown to
              become an independent, mature 64-bit Linux distribution while
              still keeping true to Puppy Linux spirit: small, fast and
              efficient". <br>
              <br>
              "Note: Fatdog uses the same packaging as Slackware (in fact Fatdog
              adopts Slackware package management tools) but is not based on
              Slackware so while you can install Slackware packages, they may or
              may not work. TXZ packages are used starting with Fatdog 700". <br>

              The Debian/Ubuntu-based Dogs do however also come in several
              flavours being specially crafted from official Debian or Ubuntu
